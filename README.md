# BGLL_community_detection
A java implementation of BGLL algorithm in [Fast unfolding of communities in large networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0476.pdf)
##Example
####start the BGLL
    ```java
    BGLL bgll = new BGLL()
    //inputPath is a origin network file
    //outPath is the result
    bgll.excuteBGLL(String inputPath, String outPath)
    ```
##Result
